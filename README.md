OpenInterface
=============

Do want to start using the [Robot Operating System](http://www.ROS.org/) [TurtleBot](http://www.turtlebot.com/) but don't have access
to a iRobot Roomba or Create platform.

Do you have an Arduino with a AFMotor shield or some other H-Bridge circuit?

Then this libary is for *you*.

This code allows an Arduino to use the iRobot Open Interface and respond as if it is a Roomba/Create robot.

Installing
----------

* click DOWNLOAD SOURCE from the top right corner.
* unpack the download.
* in your sketches folder create a "libraries" folder if one doesn't exist.
* copy the unpacked OpenInterface folder into that "libraries".
* restart the the Arduino IDE, you should now see OpenInterface under the "File/Examples" menu.  
 
Look at the example, OIBot.

Enjoy
